# Guess-the-Number-Game
It's a simple terminal game where you have to guess the number that was randomly generated.

It was written in simple rust. So to run the game you need to have rust installed.
Run the "cargo run" command in the terminal.

Update:
  - Used std::String's 'to_uppercase()' for more neat looking code.
  - Added error handeling.
  - Made code a little neater.
  - Added colour.
